# SingStar Custom Microphone Guide
### Guide for using a custom microphone on any SingStar game for PS3
I've found an easy way to use custom microphones on any SingStar game (always with the official USB converter) with my MacBook and a 3.5mm jack cable.

## For this guide, you'll need:
- A MacBook (a Windows laptop should also work)
- The SingStar USB converter
- A 3.5mm jack cable

## Instructions:
### Step 1
Plug in the jack cable to the USB converter and MacBook.

### Step 2
Go to settings, then sound. Choose the headphone port as output.

### Step 3
Install OBS, run it and create a new Audio Input Capture source, then, select the microphone you'd like to use.
Now, press the settings button on the audio mixer, which is next to the sources space.
Then, set Audio Monitoring as "Monitor and Input" on the Audio Input Capture source.
You can customize the sound volume both on OBS and Mac settings in case it does not sound good, but your microphone should now be ready to use on SingStar!
